Basic Authentication using Bcyrpt. 

This application simply utilises the bCrypt package to check the authenticity of the users. 

It currently does not have any constraints on how the password should be structured. 

The app writes the username and their hashed password value to a mongoDB database when a user Registers and retreives it for login.
